old stuff, notes, tools and the updater.

<hr/>


the updater uses nodejs and `aria2c.cmd`
those are not preset at the folder and can be downloaded at:  

https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/v19.0.0-nightly202206243507b3f9a9/win-x86/node.exe  

and

https://github.com/eladkarako/win_aria2c/releases/download/release-1.36.0/patched_aria2-1.36.0-win-32bit-build1.zip
or  
https://github.com/eladkarako/win_aria2c/releases/download/release-1.36.0/patched_aria2-1.36.0-win-64bit-build1.zip

you can either put them in the same folder or in the system path.
